        <p>In addition to the new stores in the area around 永康街 where 岳父母 live, I notice on my way back from the park that there is also now an Under Armour store. I actually like this, as I own quite a few of their items. They are like the testosterone-fueled version of lululemon. It also makes sense for 台北. In this hot, wet climate it is advantageous to have lightweight clothing that dries quickly.</p>
        <p>Our early morning snack is almost a breakfast in itself: slices of orange, pieces of dried fruit (芭樂乾，櫻桃乾，藍莓乾，草莓乾) and flaky, sesame-crusted biscuits filled with green onion. But all that is just an appetizer.</p>
        <p>Today we will be having 米粉湯, 孝萱最喜歡的早餐. On all of our five trips to 臺灣, I think this has been our first breakfast. However, this is the first time we are taking 安得. She's finally old enough to experience it for herself.</p>
        <p>It is a short walk to the 東門 traditional market. The market is a maze of indoor and outdoor alleys spanning several blocks on the other side of the 東門 MRT station from the apartment. Just off 信義路, right inside one of the market's entrances is <a href="https://www.yelp.com.tw/biz/黃媽媽米粉湯-中正區-2">黃媽媽米粉湯</a>. This place is a 台北 institution run by a tiny matriarch who specializes in (and wins awards for) 米粉湯: thin rice noodles in savory broth served with side dishes that include any part of a pig that you can think of – and maybe a few you can’t. Pig intestine seems to be a house favorite, and 孝萱 enjoys that along with pig lung, pig heart, some pig jowl (something more ‘normal’ for me) and fried tofu (which 安得 will prefer).</p>

      <p>The first time I ate any of this it was extremely foreign. Even thought it’s now familiar, the pig lung and pig intestine will never be my favorites. All together it’s not anything I ever thought I would be eating for breakfast just 10 years ago, but now it is part of our ritual. It’s nice that 安得 can finally join us. As always, she is willing to try everything, but she is not a fan of the tougher and chewy texture of the lung, heart, and intestine. But at least she tried and she didn’t say anything bad about them. She simply and politely said no to additional servings.</p>
