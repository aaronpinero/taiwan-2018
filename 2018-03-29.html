        <h2>Pre-flight</h2>
        <p>The last time our family went to 臺灣 was Chinese New Year in 2016. Since then, I haven’t had more than a week of vacation at a time, and no more than a few days at a time in the last year. I think I’ve aged a five years in the last two. My hair is grey and falling out. I’ve had a lot of stress-related health issues. I look like crap, with darkening circles around my eyes. I don’t always feel it, but I can see it when I look in the mirror in the morning: I’m tired.</p>
        <p>It’s time to take a long break.</p>

        <p>So here we are at JFK's Terminal 1 waiting for our <a href="https://www.evaair.com">EVA Airlines</a> flight to 台北. We haven’t flown with EVA for a while, opting instead for <a href="http://www.china-airlines.com">China Airlines</a> and their <a href="https://www.china-airlines.com/us/en/fly/on-board/fleet/family-couch">Family Couch</a> option. Unfortunately, all the China Airlines flight were full when it came time to buy our tickets, so EVA it is.</p>
        <p>This year was the first time we needed to plan around the public school calendar. 安得 is in kindergarten now. In an effort to keep her from missing too much school time, we are traveling during her Spring break. She will still miss a week of school, but that’s not so bad for a kindergarten student. Her reading skill level is ahead of her other classmates, so missing a little time will not leave her behind. Instead, she will have an opportunity – like me – to work on her 中文.</p>
        <p>This year has not been too bad. I am making good on my efforts to develop personal projects and inject more fun and more opportunities for creativity into my work. My framework project (<a href="http://aaronpinero.net/tyfy/docs/index.html">Tyfy</a>) is starting to mature as I use to develop new website themes. But I’m not going to be able to keep it up if I don’t take some time to rest. That’s what this trip is going to be about for me. I need to rest, to get healthy, and 練習中文. I turned 42 yesterday, and I can think of no better gift to myself.</p>
        <p>For 安得, this may be the first trip to 臺灣 that she will remember when she gets older. We've taken her twice before – once for her 2<sup>nd</sup> birthday, and then a year and a half later. The trips were great for her. I watched with pride as she enjoyed new experiences, practiced her language skills and socialized with 孝萱的家人. But she doesn't have many memories of these trips. She only remember's little bits and pieces if we prompt her. I think this time will be different.</p>
        <p>But first there’s the flight. Fifteen hours of movies, sleep, airplane food, and battle against fatigue and stiffness.</p>

        <h2>在飛機上</h2>
        <p>The plane is – like me – older and worn down as compared to the plane for our last EVA Air flight. We are in the very back of the plane amongst many other families with small children. This flight is popular with the families. There doesn’t seem to be as many business travelers in coach.</p>
        <p>The flight experience is about the same quality as the plane. There is a lot of turbulence. The flight crew is pleasant on the surface but just going through the motions. The food is a bogey; the only bright spot is the carrot cake: 孝萱 hates it; I think it is okay; and 安得 loves it. Even the movie I first pick to watch – ‘Justice League’ – is completely lackluster.</p>

        <p>安得 is totally bored. The cartoons aren’t long enough and we haven’t taken out the iPad yet. The crew gave all the kids a kit that lets them make a hat or a mask. She liked that, but it only occupied her for 10 minutes.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>There are now six hours left on our flight to Taiwan, and none of us are having much luck sleeping. 安得 is having a difficult time getting comfortable enough to sleep. I am currently giving my seat to the ladies so that 安得 can lay down for a while. She’s just not good at sleeping of she has to be sitting up.</p>
        <p>Getting up and around the cabin also helps me avoid the area near the bathrooms in the rear of the plane. They are beginning to smell really bad. On a full flight with lots of kids, I guess this is to be expected.</p>

        <p>I am writing this at about 10pm local time on the 30th of March in 台北. I will fall asleep as soon as I lie down, so I am just going to write this really quick. We got into 台北桃園飛機場 around 5:30pm local and finally made it onto a city-bound bus at exactly 7pm. 孝萱 is a little loopy from having not slept, while I’m experiencing some occasional dizziness. We were met at the airport by 岳父母. They guided us to the bus and arranged our tickets. On the hour ride to 台北市, 安得 described every detail her flight experience to her 婆婆 while 孝萱 and I napped.</p>
        <p>The bus took us to the 行天宮 MRT station. From there we took the Yellow line to 東門 station. The area around 東門 has changed, becoming even more trendy and commercial than before. There is an Arc’terex store, a shiny new multi-story bar, and a Starbucks. I think it’s the Starbucks that really nailed it for me. Too much of America is intruding on what I hoped would remain charmingly foreign. At least there isn’t a McDonalds – yet.</p>
        <p>岳父母 have an apartment in a quiet alley not far from the Friday night bustle in this commercial paradise. We make the ritual climb of 4 flights with our heavy suitcases and can finally rest. We made it.</p>
        <p>Now I’m going to get to sleep and hope that the mosquitos don’t eat me up while I’m defenseless.</p>
