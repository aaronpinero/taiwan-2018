        <h2>Pre-flight</h2>
        <p>The last time we went to 臺灣 was for Chinese New Year in 2016. Since then, I haven’t taken more than a week of vacation at a time, and no more than a few days in the last year. I think I’ve aged a few more than two years since that last trip. My hair is grey and falling out. I’ve had a lot of (so far) minor health issues that I think are related to stress. I look like crap, with darkening circles around my eyes. I don’t always feel it, but I can see it when I look in the mirror in the morning. I’m tired.</p>
        <p>It’s about time I take a break.</p>
        <p>So here we are in Terminal 1 at JFK, waiting for our flight on EVA airlines to 台北. We haven’t flown with EVA for a while, opting instead for China Airlines and their Family Couch option. But we missed out on getting tickets for our preferred travel date this year, so EVA it is.</p>
        <p>This year was the first time we needed to work around the public school calendar. 安得 is in kindergarten now. In an effort to keep her from missing too much school time on our trip, we are traveling during her Spring break. She will still miss a week of school, but that’s not so bad for a kindergarten student. Her reading skill level is ahead of her other classmates, so missing a little time will not be bad. Instead, she will have an opportunity – like me – to work on her 中文.</p>
        <p>This year has not been too bad so far. I am making good on my efforts to develop personal projects and inject more fun and more opportunities for design into my work. My framework project (Tyfy) is starting to mature as I use to develop new website themes, and I am finding ways to be more creative in the work that I do. But I’m not going to be able to keep it up if I don’t take some time to rest. That’s what this trip is going to be about for me. I need to rest, to get healthy, and 練習中文. I turned 42 yesterday, and I can think of no better gift to myself.</p>
        <p>But first there’s the flight. Fifteen hours of movies, sleep, airplane food, and battle against fatigue and stiffness.</p>

        <h2>在飛機上</h2>
        <p>The plane is – like me – older and worn down as compared to the plane for our last EVA Air flight. We are in the very back of the plane amongst many other families with small children. This flight is popular with the families. There doesn’t seem to be as many business travelers in coach.</p>
        <p>The flight experience is about the same quality as the plane. There is a lot of turbulence. The flight crew is pleasant on the surface but just going through the motions. The food is a bogey; the only bright spot is the carrot cake: 孝萱 hates it; I think it is okay; and 安得 loves it. Even the movie I first pick to watch--‘Justice League’--is completely lackluster.</p>
        <p>安得 is totally bored. The cartoons aren’t long enough and we haven’t taken out the iPad yet. The crew did hand out a little kit to the kids that lets them make a hat or a mask. She liked that, but it only occupied her for 10 minutes.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>There are about six hours left on our flight to Taiwan, and none of us are having much luck sleeping. I am at least having some success keeping the sore throat away. 安得 is having a difficult time getting comfortable enough to sleep, despite having more room in the seat than me or 孝萱. I am currently giving my seat to them so that 安得 can lay down for a while. She’s just not good at sleeping of she has to be sitting up.</p>
        <p>Getting up and around the cabin also helps me avoid the area near the bathrooms in the rear of the plane which are beginning to smell really bad. On a flight with lots of kids, I guess this is to be expected.</p>

        <h2>在台北</h2>
        <p>I am writing this at about 10pm local time on the 30th of March in 台北. I will fall asleep as soon as I lie down, so I am just going to write this really quick. We got into 台北桃園飛機場 around 5:30pm local and finally made it onto a city-bound bus at exactly 7pm. 孝萱 is a little loopy from having not slept, while I’m dead tired and experiencing some occasional dizziness. We were met at the airport by 孝萱的父母 and they guided us to the bus and arranged our tickets. While 安得 described her flight experience to her 婆婆, 孝萱 and I napped.</p>
        <p>The bus took us to an MRT station at 行天宮, and from their we took the Yellow line to 東門 station. The area around 東門 has changed some, becoming even more trendy and commercial than before. There is an Arc’terex store, a shiny new bar, and a Starbucks. I think it’s the Starbucks that really nailed it for me. Too much of America intruding on what I wanted to remain mysteriously foreign. At least there isn’t a McDonalds – yet.</p>
        <p>岳父母 have an apartment in a quiet alley not far from the bustle of Friday night in this commercial paradise. We make the ritual climb of 4 flights with our heavy suitcases and can finally rest. We made it.</p>
        <p>Now I’m going to get to sleep and hope that the mosquitos don’t eat me up while I’m defenseless.</p>
