        <h2>Pre-flight</h2>
        <p>The last time we traveled to <span data-def="Taiwan">臺灣</span> was for Chinese New Year in 2016. Since then, I haven’t had more than a week of vacation at a time, and no more than a few days at a time in the last year. I think I’ve aged a five years in the last two. My hair is grey and falling out. I’ve had a lot of stress-related health issues. I have darkening circles around my eyes. I don’t always feel it, but I can see it when I look in the mirror in the morning: I’m tired.</p>
        <p>Time to take a long break.</p>

        <p>So here we are at JFK's Terminal 1 waiting for our <a href="https://www.evaair.com">EVA Airlines</a> flight to <span data-def="Taipei">台北</span>. We haven’t flown with EVA for a while. On our last two trips, we chose to fly <a href="http://www.china-airlines.com">China Airlines</a> because of their <a href="https://www.china-airlines.com/us/en/fly/on-board/fleet/family-couch">Family Couch</a> option. This year all the China Airlines flight were full when it came time to buy our tickets, so EVA it is.</p>
        <p>This year was the first time we needed to plan around the public school calendar. <span data-def="our daughter's Chinese name" data-pinyin="ān dé">安得</span> is in kindergarten now. In an effort to keep her from missing too many school days, we are traveling during her Spring break. She will still miss a week of school, but that’s not so bad for a kindergarten student. Her reading skill level is ahead of her other classmates, so missing a little time will not leave her behind. Instead, she will have an opportunity – like me – to work on her 中文.</p>
        <p>For 安得, this may be the first trip to 臺灣 that she will remember when she gets older. We've taken her twice before – once for her 2<sup>nd</sup> birthday, and then a year and a half later. The trips were great for her. I enjoyed watching her have new experiences, practice her language skills and socialize with <span data-def="my wife‘s family">孝萱的家人</span>. But she doesn't have many memories of these trips. She only recalls bits and pieces if we prompt her. I hope that this time she'll be able to carry the experience with her.</p>
        <p>But first, the flight: fifteen hours of movies, sleep, airplane food, and battle against fatigue and stiffness.</p>

        <h2>在飛機上</h2>
        <p>The plane we are on is – like me – older and worn down as compared to our last trip. We are in the very back of the plane amongst many other families with small children. There doesn’t seem to be many business travelers in coach. The plane is also packed full. There might be one empty seat in the entire section, and this is always the last section to fill up.</p>
        <p>The flight experience is about the same quality as the plane. There is frequent turbulence causing the captain to ask everyone to stay belted into their seats. The crew is pleasant on the surface but just going through the motions. The food is a bogey; the only bright spot in our first meal is a slice of carrot cake; <span data-def="my wife's Chinese name" data-pinyin="xiào xuān">孝萱</span> hates it but I think it is okay and 安得 loves it. Even the movie I pick to watch – ‘Justice League’ – is completely mediocre.</p>

          <div class="imgframe">

        <p>安得 is persistently bored. The cartoons on the in-flight entertainment system aren’t very long, so they don't hold her attention. The crew gave all the kids a kit they can use to make a hat or a mask. She liked that, but it only occupied her for 10 minutes. We might need to take out the iPad and let her watch some of the cartoons we downloaded.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>There are now six hours left on our flight to 臺灣. None of us are having much luck sleeping. 安得 cannot get comfortable enough to sleep. She won't sleep well while sitting up. I am currently giving my seat to the ladies so that 安得 can lay down for a while.</p>
        <p>Getting up and around the cabin allows me to stretch and relieve some of the swelling in my feet. It also helps me avoid the area near the bathrooms in the rear of the plane. They are beginning to smell. On a full flight with lots of kids, I guess this is to be expected.</p>

        <h2>在台北</h2>
        <figure class="position-right size-50 orientation-landscape">
          <div class="imgframe">
            <img alt="Photograph of a sign in an airport" data-src="resources/img/20180329/20180329-sign.jpg" src="resources/img/img_preload.png">

        <p>I am writing this at about 10pm local time on the 30th of March in 台北. I will fall asleep as soon as I lie down, so I am just going to write this really quick. We got into 台北桃園飛機場 around 5:30pm local and finally made it onto a city-bound bus at exactly 7pm. 孝萱 is a little loopy from having not slept, while I’m experiencing some occasional dizziness. We were met at the airport by <span data-pinyin="yuè fù mŭ" data-def="father and mother in law">岳父母</span>. They guided us to the bus departure area and arranged our tickets. On the hour ride to 台北市, 安得 described every detail her flight experience to her <span data-def="grandmother" data-pinyin="pó pó">婆婆</span> while 孝萱 and I napped.</p>
        <p>The bus took us to the <span data-def="Xing Tian Temple">行天宮</span> MRT station. From there we took the Yellow line to 東門 station. The area around 東門 has changed, becoming even more trendy and commercial than before. There is an <a href="arcteryx.com">Arc’terex</a> store, a shiny new multi-story bar, and a Starbucks. I think it’s the Starbucks that really nailed it for me. Too much of America is intruding on what I hoped would remain charmingly foreign. At least there isn’t a <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com.tw/tw/ch/index.html">McDonalds</a> – yet.</p>
        <p>岳父母 have an apartment in a quiet alley not far from 東門 station and the surrounding Friday night bustle. We make the ritual climb to the 4th floor with our heavy suitcases and then finally rest. We made it.</p>
        <p>Now I’m going to get to sleep and hope that the mosquitos don’t eat me up while I’m defenseless.</p>
