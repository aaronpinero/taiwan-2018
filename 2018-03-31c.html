        <p>One of the things that 安得 has been most looking forward to is to see 巧虎. 巧虎 is a Japanese cartoon character whose closest English analog is Daniel Tiger. 安得 has a subscription with the company that markets 巧虎 in Taiwan and receives a package every month that includes a 巧虎 activity book, story book, stickers, and some sort of game or toy. The last time we visited Taiwan, the highlight of the trip her was going to see a 巧虎電影. There is no movie out right now, but there is a 巧虎 exhibit (of sorts) being held in a public art space about a 15 minute walk from the apartment. After an amazing lunch prepared by 岳父母 -- including 蔥油餅, broccoli, cooked greens, vegetables and 豆腐皮, bitter mellon, pickled cabbage, and stewed meat -- we are on our way. We hope a nice afternoon walk will help keep the exhaustion at bay for a few more hours.</p>

        <p>It is 80 degrees – warm for a bunch of New Yorkers in March. We walk in the shade and there is a great breeze, making even the heat of the day feel quite comfortable.</p>

        <p>There is something very Brooklyn about the <a href="https://www.huashan1914.com/w/huashan1914/index">Huashan 1914 Creative Park</a>. It is a collection of old buildings that have been repurposed as gallery spaces, shops, cafes, and restaurants. There are at least two exhibitions going on at the moment: 可愛巧虎島 and 大同. 大同 is a venerable Taiwanese consumer electronics brand that grew from making televisions and fans in the 60s to all manner of appliances today – including some very attractive UHD LED televisions. Their exhibit is a celebration of their history and an advertisement for their latest products.</p>
        <p>可愛巧虎島 is disappointingly small and crowded. It is clearly targeted to an audience that is a year or two younger than 安得, but she is so exhausted I don’t think she minds. She is most interested in the areas of the exhibit where they are showing 巧虎 cartoons. It is the perfect thing for a tired kindergartener to do. The rest of the exhibit is packed with loud young children and adults waving smartphone cameras. It’s not the sort of situation in which 安得 is most comfortable. But it is worth it to give her an hour or so of entertainment with her favorite Chinese character.</p>

        <p>By 4pm, I am dying. I cannot shake the urge to lay down and I am constantly yawning. Even a good iced mocha latte can only keep me going long enough for the walk back to the apartment. 回家的時候, I can no longer stand. I get in bed and fight unconsciousness for an hour before finally surrendering. I don't event make it to dinner.</p>
