        <p>昨天晚上很難睡. Even thought I went right to sleep after hitting the bed, I was only able to stay asleep for 90 minutes. It was like that all through the night. I would go to sleep for what felt like a long time, and then I would wake up and check the clock and only minutes would have passed. From 10:30pm until I finally gave up on sleep at 5am, I probably only slept a total of 4 hours.</p>
        <p>At least the weather is really nice. I’ve been looking forward to visiting the park, and that’s the first thing I want to do this morning. Sunrise is at about 5:50am, so I convince 安得 – who is awake and surprisingly chipper – to go with me for a very early morning walk. On the way, I explain jet lag to her.</p>

        <p><a href="https://parks.taipei/Web/Park/Detail/541BF1ED9DF84D93B64A38B27D9D23D6">大安森林公園</a> is about a block away. As we walk through the quiet early morning alleys, I can look up and see a little bit of light shining on the clouds from the direction of the horizon. Today is <span data-def="Saturday" data-pinyin="xīng qī lìu">星期六</span> so very few people are up and about.</p>
        <p>We follow the path that goes around the perimeter of the park. The spring flowers are in full bloom, the trees are lush, and the park is bustling with birds and small, dark brown squirrels. As 安得 remarks, there is also 好多老人 engaged in all sorts of early morning exercise routines: jogging, walking, stretching, dancing, martial arts. We are so early that some of the activities have not yet started. We pass a few instructors setting up their boom boxes and speakers in anticipation of a class.</p>

        <p>About 3 years ago, the city added a large playground and sand pit at the northeast corner of the park, adjacent a beautiful new MRT station. No other <span data-def="literally “little friends”" data-pinyin="xiăo péng yŏu">小朋友</span> are up this early, so 安得 has the run of the place while I watch the sun rise behind Taipei 101’s towering silhouette.</p>

        <p>There are several new art installations at the park designed around the theme ‘記得說愛’ – remember to say love. There are wire sculptures, arrangements of plants and flowers, or cartoon-like statues. They add cuteness to the colorful springtime blooms. More importantly, 安得 loves them.</p>
        <p>On the way out of the park, we run into 岳母. She walks back to the apartment with us so we can have a little snack while we wait for our breakfast destination to be open. I am starving, so a little snack before breakfast – while perhaps excessive – sounds like a great idea.</p>
