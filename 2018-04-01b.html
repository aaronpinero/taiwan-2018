        <p><span data-pinyin="wŭ cān" data-def="lunch">午餐</span> is another impressive spread prepared by 岳父母. This time there is a huge vegetable soup with roots, cabbage, and corn accompanied by stewed beef, some of the leftover <span data-def="vegetables" data-pinyin="shū cài">蔬菜</span> from yesterday, and purple rice. There is also an attractive plate of 水果: 芭樂, 草莓, and 枇杷. 安得 asks me if this is dinner. She’s not used to such an elaborate lunch. I simply tell her that we are on vacation so we are having special lunches.</p>

        <p>岳母 prepares what I consider to be very traditional Chinese-style meals when we are visiting. There are always several different shared dishes, heavy on cooked vegetables. There is almost always noodles or rice, and very often there is a soup. 岳母 is also very diligent about using leftovers. Nothing goes to waste. We need to be following her example.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>After lunch, we are going to visit a bookstore. Across the street from the elementary school that 孝萱 attended as a child, there is a book and stationary store that caters to school students. They have all sorts of school supplies, art supplies, games, and toys. 孝萱 is looking for books that will help 安得 learn 注音 – the phonetic system used in Taiwan to help teach children to read Mandarin – and to practice writing 漢字. For 安得 the trip will be her first opportunity to go shopping for herself. For 春節 she received 紅包 with a total of about NT200. Since February she has been looking forward to going to 臺灣 and spending her cash. The challenge for us as parents is to teach 安得 some restraint. She is five, so she wants to buy the first thing she sees that looks cool to her. 孝萱 and I try to counsel patience, telling her that she should look around at things first. She can always go back and buy that first thing if she doesn’t see anything else that interests her.</p>
        <p>It’s been a long time since I really looked in a bookstore like this – it’s been a while since I’ve been a student. School supplies have changed a bit since I was a kid, and in Asia that difference is multiplied. The bookstore has some of the most interesting things I have seen. 安得 immediately sees something she wants, and I have to agree with her: pens that have up to six different colors. I remember multi-color pens from when I was a kid (black, blue, and red in the same click-pen) but these are even better. There are some that are red, black, blue, green and a mechanical pencil. 安得 wants a pen that has all of the rainbow colors. There are a few that are empty which you can fill with a various ink colors that are sold separately. In addition to the pens, there are also mechanical pencils of different diameters and many different pencil lead colors. I’ve never seen anything other than the default graphite, so this is eye-opening. 安得 and I are both wowed by the colors available. There are also erasable pens and erasable highlighters that work really well; both types are available in many colors. As designers, 孝萱 and I are as excited as 安得. She cannot wait to take her pen to the cashier to pay.</p>
        <p>Before buying, we continue looking around. The store sells paperclips in different shapes; notebooks with lay-flat spines; glue sticks of different colors and brands; tape dispensers that look like food; and a seemingly endless array of stickers. If 安得 hadn’t already received hundreds of stickers as a gift from a friend of 岳父母, we might have let her buy some. As it is, she is covering her shirt – and other things – with stickers every day.</p>
        <p>When we finally finish browsing, 安得 shyly approaches the cashier to pay her crisp NT100 bill. 孝萱 has told the gentleman that this is the first time 安得 has bought something for herself, so he tells her congratulations. She just smiles and lets us know that she wants to get back home as soon as possible.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>The evening passes quietly. 安得 plays with her new pen and one of the books that 孝萱 purchased at the store. 孝萱弟弟 visits for dinner in the evening, but both 安得 and I are very tired. She sits at the dinner table staring off into space and picking at her food in a desultory manner. Only the mention of 芒果雪花冰 for dessert makes her perk up. Admittedly it does the same for me. I’ve been looking forward to this since we arrived.</p>
        <p>I’ve written about the Smoothie House (formerly the Ice Monster) and their 芒果雪花冰 on previous trips. It is a block away and the only things that stop me from getting it as often as I can are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I cannot have that much sweet stuff all the time</li>
          <li>The line can be incredibly long</li>
        </ul>
        <p>芒果雪花冰 and Smoothie House might be the most popular and well known things for foreigners visiting 台北. There’s good reason. As I explain to 孝萱弟弟, there are other places that serve shaved ice with mango, but there doesn’t seem to be any place in the United States that can replicate the flavor and consistency of the shaved ice. Also, the servings here are larger. So anything that we might be able to get back home is a pale imitation of the real thing. That usually doesn’t stop 安得 from wanting some, but her in 台北 I know that we’re getting the best.</p>

        <p>For tonight's dessert, 安得 chooses the mango shaved ice with mango sorbet, mango puree, and an assortment of fruit: 芒果, 奇異果, and 草莓. 孝萱 has a little bit, but mostly it’s me and 安得 that finish it off. By the time we’re done, I’m cold and happy. I’m also ready for bed.</p>
