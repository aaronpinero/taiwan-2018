        <p>昨天晚上很難睡. Even thought I went right to sleep after hitting the bed, I was only able to stay asleep for 90 minutes. It was like that all through the night. I would go to sleep for what felt like a long time, and then I would wake up and check the clock and only minutes would have passed. From 10:30pm until I finally gave up on sleep at 5am, I probably only slept a total of 4 hours.</p>
        <p>At least the weather is really nice. I’ve been looking forward to visiting the park, and that’s the first thing I want to do this morning. Sunrise is at about 5:50am, so I convince 安得 – who is awake and surprisingly chipper – to go with me for a very early morning walk. On the way, I explain jet lag to her.</p>

        <p><a href="https://parks.taipei/Web/Park/Detail/541BF1ED9DF84D93B64A38B27D9D23D6">大安森林公園</a> is barely a block away from where 岳父母 live in 台北. As we walk through the quiet early morning alleys, I can look up and see a little bit of light shining on the clouds from the direction of the horizon. It’s early and today is 星期六 so very few people are up and about.</p>
        <p>We follow the path that goes around the perimeter of the park. It’s spring, so the flowers are in full bloom, the trees are lush, and the park is bustling with birds and small, dark brown squirrels. As 安得 remarks, there is also 好多老人 engaged in all sorts of early morning exercise routines: jogging, walking, stretching, dancing, martial arts. It’s early, so some of the activities have not yet started.</p>

        <p>Back about 3 years ago, the city added a great little playground on the northeast corner of the park, near the also-new MRT station. No other 小朋友 are up this early, so 安得 has the run of the place while I watch the sun rise majestically behind Taipei 101’s silhouette.</p>

        <p>There are several new installations at the park designed around the theme ‘記得說愛’ – remember to say love. They add cuteness to the already colorful springtime blooms. More importantly, 安得 loves them.</p>
