        <p>I slept much better. I got about 9 hours – from 5 to 9 last night and then from midnight to 5 this morning. Like yesterday, I woke early went for a  beautiful pre-dawn walk in 大安, this time with 孝萱. The park is preparing some sort of event around the Taipei 2018 Azalea Festival which goes from mid-March to mid-April.</p>
        <p>When we return from our walk 安得 is awake and 孝萱 and I are famished. I didn’t have dinner last night so I am really ready for some breakfast. One of our favorite places to visit in 台北 is called 禾禾豆漿店. 豆漿 is soy milk, a very popular breakfast item consumed both as a drink and also like a soup or cereal (with other things in it). 禾禾豆漿店 is a short walk thought the neighborhood, past the elementary school where 孝萱 went as a child. The place is more of a food stall than a restaurant, but there are tables set up on the sidewalk for patrons who are not getting their breakfast to go.</p>
        <p>In addition to 豆漿 – which I'm not crazy about but 安得 likes – 禾禾豆漿店 serves wonderful 蔥油餅. I like mine with scrambled egg; 安得 has the same. 孝萱 wants 燒餅 – prepared like a pita with delicious scrambled egg inside. For drinks, I have a 冰的奶茶; 安得 has 豆漿; and 孝萱 gets 豆漿紅茶. The tea is not very good but, as 孝萱 says, that is part of the experience.</p>

        <p>On the way back from breakfast we pass by the Mormon temple where 安得 briefly played when she was barely two years old. It was summer then, our first trip to 臺灣 with 安得. It was a hot and very humid morning. 安得, sweaty and tired, enjoyed running up and down the stairs and ramps in front of the temple's entrance. She doesn't remember it now, but I can show her the video later.</p>
        <p>When we return to the apartment after breakfast, 岳母 has a trait for me: 枇杷. This is a fruit I’ve never heard of or tried. It is like nothing I’ve ever had before. You peel the skin to eat it, and the flesh is a bit like that of a cantaloupe. There are two or three shiny black seeds in the middle that are about the size of a small plum stone. It is not as sweet as cantaloupe, but just a juicy.</p>

        <p>I look it up on Wikipedia, and the English name for 枇杷 is loquat. I actually know this name even though I’ve never seen the fruit. The leaf of the loquat tree is used to make a popular Chinese cough remedy.</p>
