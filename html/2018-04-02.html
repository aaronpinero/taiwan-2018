        <p>孝萱不舒服, so she decides to nap after breakfast. Later today we are going to do some shopping, but for now we have some free time. 岳母 and I take 安得 to the park again to burn off some of her energy. She is very excited for another opportunity to look around the park. I let her take some pictures with my phone since she doesn’t have her camera with her.</p>

        <p>After walking around in the morning sun, we stop by the MRT station on the north end of the park for a bathroom break and an iced coffee. The MRT station is an attractive glass and metal structure with a sunken garden and atrium on the mezzanine level. The cafe, one in a chain of places in Taipei named Cafe Louisa, is situated on a terrace overlooking the garden. Like the many cafes that occupy 台北 neighborhoods, this one has a deliberately western style. Coffee rivals tea in importance, especially with younger 台灣人 and 外國人. I stumble through ordering a relatively expensive beverage — 80 NT, or nearly 3 dollars.</p>
        <p>孝萱 is awake when we return to the apartment, so after a quick change of clothes for 安得, we can be on our way again. Today we are going to Taipei 101, the city's iconic skyscraper. The base of the building is a huge, multistory luxury mall. In the bottom level of the mall is a food court, a few restaurants, gift shops, and a supermarket called <a href="http://www.jasons.com.tw">Jason’s</a>. Jason's  is a specialty story, carrying western and international foodstuffs. 孝萱 and I are going to prepare a meal for 岳父母 — a dish we often enjoy at home: ditalini pasta, cooked risotto style with green beans, ground lamb, lemon, mint, and Parmesan cheese. It is based on a recipe we received as part of our subscription to Blue Apron. Even 安得 loves it; she says it's her favorite meal. We’ve often talked about it and 岳父母 would like to try it. At Jason’s we can buy ingredients that are usually hard to find in Taiwan: pasta, Parmesan cheese, and mint.</p>
        <p>At Taipei 101 will also be able to check an item off our must-have list: a meal at <a href="https://www.dintaifung.com.tw">Din Tai Fung</a>. The restaurant’s flagship location is right down the street from where we are staying, but that restaurant is small and constantly packed with tourists. They have a newer, larger and fancier location in Taipei 101.</p>
        <p>Taipei 101 is visible from the entrance to the MRT station near the apartment. Getting there is a short subway ride. Every time I visit 台北 I marvel at how great the subway is here as compared to in New York. Every station has escalators and elevators. 安得, who is a little bit scared of escalators, is getting used to them due to all of our trips into and out of the 地鐵站. The stations are a dependable place to take a child to use the bathroom since you can expect that they will be relatively clean and well-maintained. The subway platforms have barriers that keep people from falling to the tracks or tossing litter. I realize this time that some of the trains have a designated family area near the middle of the train. This is probably nice for parents traveling with children and also for other riders who might rather avoid them.</p>

        <p>When we arrive at Taipei 101, it is lunch time, so 孝萱 puts our name on the waiting list at Din Tai Fung. The restaurant, experienced in dealing with large crowds and quickly turning over tables, has developed a very efficient system. There are 4 waiting lists, each for a different size party. When you put your name on the list, they give you a menu so that you can out your order while you wait. Since 安得 is with us, we are going to avoid ordering a lot of spicy dishes, but we are still going to have some favorites: 小籠包 (for which they are famous), 粽子, spicy cucumbers, and some 菠菜 to make sure we have something healthy. The total cost for the three of us to have lunch at one of the most popular restaurants in 台北 is NT599, or about 21 dollars.</p>

        <p>Unlike most of the restaurants we will our trip, this one is exceptionally roomy, like something from suburban America. It is only complaint I have is that the dining room is one big open space, and the acoustics are a challenge. For entertainment, there is an exposed kitchen area in the center of the dining room where you can watch the staff prepare the 小籠包. 安得 likes watching them, and wants to know why they are all wearing face masks. They look like kitchen surgeons or the staff of a clean room. Indeed the only dirty surface is where they are currently rolling dough.</p>

        <p>As has been our previous experience, the service is incredible. The numerous staff members are polite and fast. 安得 barely has any time to be distracted before the first dish arrives. She is too old for a high chair now, but we do request children’s dishes and utensils for her. They are enameled stainless steel in Tiffany blue, an upgrade from the plastics they used to have. The one omission is the lack of children’s chopsticks. Still, 安得 manages well enough, even with the tricky 小籠包.</p>

        <p>After lunch, we head to Jason’s to do our shopping. Jason’s is a lot like a Wegman’s back in the US. They are unique in 台北 because they carry a lot of international brands and products -- particularly European ones. They actually have a cheese counter. They also have an extensive collection of liquor.</p>
        <p>One thing about food stores in 台北 is that they still offer a lot of free samples for things. One counter in the food court outside Din Tai Fung was offering tastes of pineapple cakes. The bakeries near the apartment hand out samples of butter biscuits. In Jason’s, the grocery staff is giving out bites of dried pork jerky. This is a lot of fun for 安得 who love to try stuff.</p>
        <p>It’s easy to find what we need. They have plenty of types of cheese and pasta, although we will need to use ditaloni instead of ditalini pasta -- the former being larger and thicker. We also get pre-shredded cheese because no one here has a cheese grater. Jason’s also has a selection of fresh herbs, so we are able to get mint. The items are more expensive than most groceries in 臺灣, but the prices are not so much more than in New York.</p>
