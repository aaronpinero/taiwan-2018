        <p>On the way back to the apartment, I notice that among all the new stores in the neighborhood there is an Under Armour store. I actually like this, as I own quite a few of their items. They are like the testosterone-loaded version of lululemon. A store like this makes sense for 台北. In the hot, wet climate it is advantageous to have lightweight clothing that dries quickly.</p>
        <p>Our early morning snack is almost a breakfast in itself: slices of orange, pieces of dried fruit (芭樂乾，櫻桃乾，藍莓乾，草莓乾) and flaky, sesame-crusted biscuits filled with green onion. But all that is just an appetizer.</p>
        <p>Today we will be having <span data-def="rice noodle soup" data-pinyin="mĭ fen tāng">米粉湯</span>, 孝萱最喜歡的早餐. On all of our five trips to 臺灣, I think this has been our first breakfast. However, this is the first time we are taking 安得. She's finally old enough to experience it for herself.</p>
        <p>It is a short walk to the 東門 traditional market. The market occupies a web of indoor and outdoor alleys spanning several blocks on the other side of the 東門 MRT station from the apartment. Just off <span data-def="XinYi Road">信義路</span>, right inside one of the market's entrances is <a href="https://www.yelp.com.tw/biz/黃媽媽米粉湯-中正區-2">黃媽媽米粉湯</a>. This place is a 台北 institution run by a tiny matriarch who specializes in (and wins awards for) 米粉湯. Hot bowls of 米粉湯 are served with side dishes that may include any part of a pig that you can think of – and maybe a few you can’t. Pig intestine seems to be a house favorite, and 孝萱 enjoys that along with pig lung, pig heart, some pig jowl (something more ‘normal’ for me) and fried tofu (which 安得 will prefer).</p>

        <p>The first time I ate any of this it was extremely foreign. Even thought it’s now familiar, the pig lung and pig intestine will never be my favorites. All together it’s not anything I ever thought I would be eating for breakfast just 10 years ago, but now it is part of our ritual. It’s nice that 安得 can finally join us. As always, she is willing to try everything, but she is not a fan of the tougher and chewy texture of the lung, heart, and intestine. At least she tried them and she didn’t say anything bad about them. She simply and politely said no to additional servings.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>After our meal and before we leave, 孝萱 and 岳母 encourage me to say hello to the 老闆, 黃媽媽 herself, and let her know in my limited Chinese that I enjoyed the meal. As with many older Taiwanese people I have met, she is amused by this and takes time out to chat with 孝萱 about me and 安得. With my limited understanding of spoken Chinese I recognize the obligatory comments about how pretty 安得 is and why is it we only have one child.</p>
        <p>We return to the apartment by way of the market. It is always fun for me to browse here and think of how different it is from any market back in the USA. The closest analog to anything back home would be a huge, everyday, year-round greenmarket. All the produce is fresh and spotlessly clean. Meat is cut and laid out on large boards. Seafood is spread out on crushed ice. I feel very close to everything as we go through the alleys. The only stalls in which any of the food is covered, wrapped or in some way shielded is where a vendor is selling a prepared food.</p>

        <p>孝萱 and 岳母 buy quite a few things for later today and this week: two different kinds of greens, unnaturally red strawberries from Japan, <span data-def="preserved egg" data-pinyin="pí dàn">皮蛋</span>, and 釋迦 – known in English as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar-apple">sugar apple or custard apple</a>.</p>
        <p>Back at the apartment, it is time to rest. Even though it is only 9am, we are exhausted.</p>
